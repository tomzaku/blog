5. 2 : Upper group(3 layer: Application, Presentation, Session)and Lower group(Transport, Network, DataLink, Physical)
Upper Group: distribute data, encryption, decryption, compression, decompression, interface.
Lower Group: data stream from a transmitting host to a destination hostâ€™s application
# Application Layer
  interface
# Presentation
  encryption,decryption,compression,decompression
# Session
  distribute data (what data is compatible what application)
# Transport
  Connection-Oriented Communication >>  TCP
  Flow Control
  Windows
