## My story:

  So for be sure, I always use "You and me" in conversation. And i realized when i's learnt something.
  It not stay in my head in 1 day.
  So I wonder why my brain or my memory so bad.
  So I find out in some website. How can I boot my memory. I realized that I do wrong everyday and it's the main reason to destroy my memory.
  First I go to bed too late and not routine. When i wake up, always consider have a luch or have a breakfast. My diet not good.
