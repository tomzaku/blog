# My story:

  Why I make this blog? I want to keep my emotion, feeling my trip in Blog. And it's memorable, dangerous ever.

  20 November, 2015.
  My Unbelievable birthday ever.

  Yesterday, I decided traveling to [Lao Bao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_B%E1%BA%A3o) from Hue city. There're 2 way from Hue City to [Lao Bao]():
  One is QL1A street and the rest is HCM street. So I make the rule "Don't go the same way". That mean morning i came at QL1A street and came back at HCM street.
  The story is not easy in this way. I started at 9:00 am from Hue city with a niece (3 years old), a sister-in-law, a friend. We had 4 people traveling to Lao Bao. Like I said, I biked at QL1A first, It's so easy to handling. The street was a good and wide. The sky was so clear, and sunny day. I finished Lao Bao city at 1pm. I had lunch at 12pm. It far from Lao Bao 11 km. So we decided go market until 2:30 pm. And we came back home. But I decided go another way. HCM Street, I want to discover the scenery and people live here. But I don't care it was bad choose when I selected. The story began at that time. We just come home with free soul, comfortable and funny talk. Take a picker, recording video of scenery. So fantastic, The scenery have more that I expect: stream, mountain, bird, people live here. They's mixing together generate peace of place. I was deep  in this solution until I realized the sky was covering dark.
